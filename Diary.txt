put it into practice again.

- Set up my coding environment by downloading the latest version of Eclipse (IDE) and Java SDK as well as
testing it on a small helloworld.java project.

05/10/2023:
- Read online about Javafx and how to use it. Watched a video of someone using it to try to understand how it works.

06/10/2023:
- Set up Javafx on my Eclipse and attempted to create a small Javafx project following a tutorial.

07/10/2023:
- Further improved my understanding of JavaFX with the installation of scene builder as a helping tool.

08/10/2023:
- Day off

09/10/2023:
- Attempted a small helloworld.java project using scene builder and javafx.

10/10/2023:
- Read about maven as a build automation tool.

15/10/2023:
- Followed a Scenebuilder tutorial online to create a small project.

16/10/2023:
- Familiarise myself with the interface of scenebuilder.

17/10/2023:
- First UML class diagram draft.

18/10/2023:

19/10/2023 to 25/10/2023:
- Drafting an initial design document, outlining expected functionalities and UI expectations.

26/10/2023 to 1/11/2023:
- Started working on tutorials on how to implement threads in java.

2/11/2023/ to 3/11/2023:

- Did thread testing and did an important commit on thread testing by learning how to create a timer for my game.

14/11/2023 to 16/11/2023:
Started writing JUnit tests using my basic classes from the UML Class Diagram (PieceType mostly).

17/11/2023 to 27/11/2023:
- Did more research about my project and how to make it as efficient as possible using concurrency whilst making progress on the game logic implementation (Board, Square, Player, Piece).

28/11/2023 to 01/12/2023:
- Improved the game logic with the use of more advanced OOP concepts such as enums to replace some of my classes (pieceType, SquareType, â€¦) and also did thorough testing for these classes for my game logic.

02/12/2023 to 04/12/2023:
- Made progress on the interim report and finished off my presentation for the project.

05/12/2023 to 07/12/2023:
