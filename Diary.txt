Appendix: Diary
01/10/2023:
- Read and Researched the rules of Stratego and watch a game online (YouTube).

02/10/2023:
- Tried to play my own stratego game to get used to the rules as well as the layout and characters movement.

03/10/2023:
- Further improved my understanding of Stratego by reading some tips and tools about how to play it well and
put it into practice again.

04/10/2023:
- Set up my coding environment by downloading the latest version of Eclipse (IDE) and Java SDK as well as
testing it on a small helloworld.java project.

05/10/2023:
- Read online about Javafx and how to use it. Watched a video of someone using it to try to understand how it works.

06/10/2023:
- Set up Javafx on my Eclipse and attempted to create a small Javafx project following a tutorial.

07/10/2023:
- Further improved my understanding of JavaFX with the installation of scene builder as a helping tool.

08/10/2023:
- Day off

09/10/2023:
- Attempted a small helloworld.java project using scene builder and javafx.

10/10/2023:
- Read about maven as a build automation tool.

15/10/2023:
- Followed a Scenebuilder tutorial online to create a small project.

16/10/2023:
- Familiarise myself with the interface of scenebuilder.

17/10/2023:
- First UML class diagram draft.

18/10/2023:
- User cases draft.

19/10/2023 to 25/10/2023:
- Drafting an initial design document, outlining expected functionalities and UI expectations.

26/10/2023 to 1/11/2023:
- Started working on tutorials on how to implement threads in java.

2/11/2023/ to 3/11/2023: 
- Day off (not overworking myself)

4/11/2023 to 10/11/2023:
- Did a small project on threads and made progress on the report.

11/11/2023 to 13/11/2023:
- Did thread testing and did an important commit on thread testing by learning how to create a timer for my game.

14/11/2023 to 16/11/2023:
Started writing JUnit tests using my basic classes from the UML Class Diagram (PieceType mostly).

17/11/2023 to 27/11/2023:
- Did more research about my project and how to make it as efficient as possible using concurrency whilst making progress on the game logic implementation (Board, Square, Player, Piece).

28/11/2023 to 01/12/2023:
- Improved the game logic with the use of more advanced OOP concepts such as enums to replace some of my classes (pieceType, SquareType, â€¦) and also did thorough testing for these classes for my game logic.

02/12/2023 to 04/12/2023:
- Made progress on the interim report and finished off my presentation for the project.

05/12/2023 to 07/12/2023:
- Implement movement and ability to attack for the pieces on the board.

25/01/2024 to 05/02/2024: 
- Added CHANGELOG.md whilst working on implementing code which allowed player to only move their respective piece

07/02/2024 to 05/03/2024:
- Merging of code done. A major issue/bug developed which did not allow me to work on my project for a very long time. Fixed after a lot of research.

11/03/2024 to 15/03/2024:
- Research on Scene Builder and JavaFX and create initial instances of the game board whilst adding other functionalities such size panels, grid pane etc. 

18/03/2024 to 26/03/2024: 
- Worked on setting up the controller and linking it with JavaFX. By this point the game board has been fully set up such as adding pieces, rules on the game board.

27/03/2024 to 29/03/2024:
- Added code that enabled it to be drag-and-dropped on the board. Continued with implementing the link between JavaFx and game logic.


30/03/2024 to 31/03/2024:
- Implemented code which allowed the player to randomly place pieces on the game board.

01/04/2024 to 03/04/2024: 
- Implement most of JavaFx whilst creating the AI and AI movement.

04/04/2024 to 05/04/2024: 
- Final touches and completion of report.
